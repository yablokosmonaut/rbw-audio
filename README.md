* Pricing is firm, and is through PayPal **F&F**.
* CONUS shipping is included (cheapest USPS option)
* Items are linked to photo albums

I understand F&F can be an trust issue and fully respect anyone's decision to avoid trading when they see it. For any open to persuasion on a case by case basis, I can at least offer the following assurances:

* 57 confirmed trades on /avexchange as of 3/23/23. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=AVexchangeBot&subject=Feedback%20Check&message=Enter%20username%20below%20that%20you%20want%20to%20check:%0A%0Au/rattlingblanketwoman">(Check with AVExchangeBot now)</a>

I made the US account US discount codes would work.)

# rbw-audio
Rattlingblanketwoman's audio classifieds

### Headphones

* ~~[VE Pro Super Nova](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tbgVABTy5Py1hca5A) **$50** You can see where the headstrap contacts the cups, no other visible wear to note. Pictured with perforated pads but only comes with stock pads.~~
* [Sennheiser HD560S](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tbgVABTy5Py1hca5A) **$100** In excellent condition, original box, cable, velor pads, and 1/4 inch jack.
* ~~[Fostex TR50P Modhouse Argon Mk3](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZSPBEwcvUwK98oDj9) **$250** Sad to let these go, but with what's needed to drive them and rare use cases (have to be at a desk) they are not in budget. Has stock protein pads, ZMF protein pads, orange cable with 3.5mm termination, black cable with 1/4 inch termination, 3.5mm-1/4 inch adapter, and Alcantara suspension band. Box too. Condition may as well be open box.~~

### IEMs and earbuds

* ~~[ISN EST50](https://photos.app.goo.gl/eucG7ZPQwoKagKNm7) **$320** Green on black stabilized wood faceplates, comes with stock cable and stock carry case, condition is excellent. Just a little too colored to be my EDC, and too expensive to keep alongside another set. I think they're a fantastically tuned bassy set, they remind me a lot of the Xenns Up. Smooth, spacious, and bass guitars never sounded so good.~~

* [Yanyin Canon](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xN6XJmoUeKBPmnaW7) **$220** Take off $6 to skip the outer box. All stock accessories. One set of flip switches is reversed but works as labeled, no issues with build or sound.

* [Penon Fan OG](https://photos.app.goo.gl/6GgVLTAdEYEJDRnu9) **$55** Stock accessories (cable, *many* tips, case (to be frank, not the greatest stock cable). Beautiful stabilized wood.

* ~~[RikuBuds Grand Archer](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kxguAzdZojaSXTPe6) **$50** I consider this one of the biggest deals listed here. These are incredible buds. They are described as being upper-mid and treble focused but I feel like they cover the full spectrum very well.~~

### Sources (DAC/DAP/AMP)

* [iFi Zen Blue DAC](https://photos.app.goo.gl/eutGcHVXjHG9RtwX6) **$100** I don't use any gear right now that would justify a dedicated DAC/AMP. Excellent condition, box, antenna, 5V power brick.

* ~~[Monolith Liquid Spark Amp](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dSwDT9X18w692ETG6) **$60** (combine with the OLDAC for $110) No blemishes or issues to mention, comes with power brick.~~

* [JDS Labs OLDAC](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CNLPwkNJEqtc8sv8A) **$50** No blemishes or issues to mention, comes with power brick.

* [DDHifi TC35i](https://photos.app.goo.gl/43QPkJmXT6KmD7LG8) **$15** It's an adapter, it works well.

* [LG V35 ThinQ](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xq4W9vszGpKT8Mmx5) **$60** It is an AT&T model, but can be flashed to an unbranded firmware or debloated using ADB commands. Battery life is great. Slight burn-in shown by nav bar, hence the photo of the "settings" screen to show shades of white. Overall very good condition indeed. There is nothing stopping this being used as phone/camera besides an excellent responsive DAP with a quad-DAC.

* [VentureCraft SounDroid Valoq](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tNeHFZK1dJbrDr2c9) **$120** I would recommend a new battery for this (circa $20 on AliX). A really fun player, a very firm power/volume knob, a jog wheel for navigation, balanced output, *very* sturdy, op-amps can be easily swapped using a hatch in the back. Condition is showing wear, including scuffs to the screen. Hopefully it goes to a collector who plans to use it. AKM4490 chip.

### Wireless buds and TWS

* [Mifo O7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/pZBkQknoXNLvUX7D7) **$50** These are the version with the CNT dinamic driver. I highly recommend them for sound, comfort, and quality of build. The case alone is a step up from competitors. Comes with accessories incl. charge cable, box, tips.

* [Aukey EP-T32](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yaqeC9pqAcpjELPC6) **$15** Box, case, tips included, no cable. Powerbeats Pro form factor.

* [Apple/Beats Studio Buds](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4rFZyWe31RJEZMLc7) **$45** Excellent condition, no tips but I can try to find something generic to include. As shown, warranty is active until 9/7/23.

* [Sony MDR-EX750BT](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mPvRYiphxaFogBMp8) **$25** This form-factor has fallen out of vogue but it's actually still very practical/comfortable. Easy to take buds out and put them back in without keeping track of them. Appearance *and* sound remind me of MH750MH755, which is hinted at in the model name too.
