Rattlingblanketwoman's audio classifieds

### Headphones

* [NIB Corsair Void RGB Elite USB](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPv-9RGfjPmv3-DVhEm67my6aUW5bwi7IgB5fEFVCc1rHarFMvDbMn8pop-GbyhBQ?key=cHpQVHpaVEJNLXhpc2tKZWxPVVducDM4OTZuZWZR) **$40** Completely sealed, a kind gift but not one I have a use for.

### IEMs and earbuds

* [Yanyin Canon](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNPQTt-p5jrirVbVY_M36ZKbP_m9v63Sr73zO6BPe_14N5OVeDH2voIH_FuKMb5lw?key=ZzA1VTNrN1JvRFVqVmdEUXRQejdWUUQwUnhZaWJn) **$215** Take off $6 to skip the outer box.

Comes in a pretty dope case with cable extension choices and tips. Can be worn down or up. Unusual appearance!

* [Moondrop Lan](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMBfk-kf3VmbHJc68Mkgw-lHQr8gje4HcK15mOyVFLOstKu0SKO4n27mswShBZRHg?key=eEItcV9UaUpFMEtaZVg4N1N6eGV2UnFtQUxLM1JB)**$25** or add on for $20

* [HBB Blon Z300](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOYGUtcC3wJafHM9dlM16MKyP89dpBfAiAX3YRwENxFN2P4hF_H8XVvxUcxIoeG1A?key=N2NsY3VNMkROWE5YV1Z4eWRQZXRiajVlX3JMaUlB)**$28** Barely listened to, despite being a huge Blon03 fan for some reason this wasn't really my jam.

* [Tin HiFi P1](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMWNhGvLR8WRiAV5GFQ26Lk4Hmll0Ic92f2IF2NrWBhxU7nEcW56gd1Ah1BoAMRTA?key=bElfdV9zeUVJQkN0b3dmc0V2QUVZYjFsTWRnUXdn) **$80** Again, these need some power to sing, but have a great flat response that even so has good bass levels, but it does have sub-bass roll-off. Carrying box and accessories (one set of silicone tips missing, I *think* the L size).

* [KBEar F1](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPCh4hf4wXD7Hctsvp9Wra_0NufsW_-3KwpsN0MxncE2ZLKiZULjYql8OF93FNYvw?key=LXRWYTVlY1JkVW5FdHc4WTVaZXBuTVRzaUcxTjF3) **$10** each, or $6 each as add-ons. Single BA. Amber has 1 pair of tips missing, smokey has everything.

* [Massive foam/gel selection of eartips](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOfteOR7X-9J7TJpQjbZLjdzOX0A9ibqgcqXi9i83boJW80Vb0oHVxOaaHD4j_RTA?key=WUYyN05ybUlBZFRYZU5mdTJOWlNGVm83OVRZY3BB) **$45** or $40 bundled. Completely unused Monster gel sets, several sealed Comply foams (all L), some Newbees, some hybrid (seem to be L) and some sealed silicones too for good measure.

* [Sealed - 1More quad-driver in-ear earphones](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOeXWry_SpW9ZAE5yo1B-aNi8AihG0kyR3a4A9Vj4NogTJIbHQ4Ei-pFy1x3hk0_g?key=VHpRUndqQ1plRTk2VTRFMHhtS3Y1N0YxZFA0dEZn) **$60** trying to price at 1/2 or below of new price, and these are still sold/in stock on Amazon and from 1More

* [Sealed - RevoNext NEX202 open-back earphones](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPZndIRDQv1poCK8IQM4IHmzRRPNUTAsLItVUUyd4NXfy4y-DDEp8TLuMumF0sNhA?key=NlNqM2VzdVJ1Q1pDNWtyUkZYekFCLTBLRlRNWkxR) **$20** or bundle for $15

* [Sealed - LZ A6](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPV2Q9hRv-KyFo1Slz92BkZg8Imgy5MQCPCondLlKBYPFzjP3BJgYC2OvUjxUZ18g?key=SmY4aVEtaXN3RWgyTlczNnI5TjlfcU4tYnJXSkNR) **$150** Looks like it sold at Penon or Linsoul for $310 when it was available, asking $150 sealed. Lots of nozzles to change tuning with, and a built in gain switch.
 
* [Sealed - NiceHCK NX7 Pro](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMk_Vid_f4ymMgTsl8ZT-TnV2umjxq_FraKR90PhMNLjINmJ00qpJU3cvWTTKvNDQ?key=SjE4VFQzdWpTQ1hLRnR6WXhxbzdkaFFmelI2YWl3) **$80** As with any of these sealed sets, sorry I can't give an impression of the sound.

* [ANew X-One 1DD, 4BA, 3 tuning chips](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMeqLbhwm6bUI2Z5DLOYJP645esU70bTWVvFeTF09496ELyTLMwSXbx90Dlh4bCBA?key=ZGRTX1E4VmxPcmR6ZFZ3c050NXh0eVpvamZWSG1R) **$150** These are being sold for over $300 new elsewhere. Used for 30 minutes.

* [Audio Technica LS200](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNLATfarveuHRhz38qUd0344IMqCtHlPO3kHGgXkxMJMkteeuVGykzismh-j5P1VQ?key=Ul9sT3ZPSEJaak1pX1lsSDVnREpzaXpWUnVLblJB) **$70** Warm sounding 2 BA set with memory wire ear guides, in red.

### Sources (DAC/DAP/AMP)

* [JDS Labs OL DAC](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMSvycc-DlPqKeYktfyMqxgEH9o8Ixe9rGIDeSbo9S6IDgObOUnGIqpi526paFEVw?key=TExzbU90S3gtUEpBbUg4bTI3Y1BLTlhnN1dnaGRB) **$45** No blemishes or issues to mention, comes with power brick.

* [F.Audio XS-02](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO_tVCHRosIN5wPTTuJDBO_GBE0M58XDSXBN6SVw1tN-nWs1j0O-uwkJ9hRrAG1-Q?key=VGNwUnN3S3puSThjYkNqYXRSTFBqTjJ0T0dsZTVR) **$75** I love this player. It has an AKM4490 chip and great dynamics. I love the clicky buttons. You can swap the op-amps out very easily. It has a low and high gain port (both 3.5mm) and takes MicroSD cards and uses MicroUSB for charging. Holds a very good charge.

* [VentureCraft SounDroid Valoq](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNWe1tQaq63Mm-039L2Q9gK-eBD8R3VPxamwHH1A2drHMyRWklWcnoBFZX0gIY1-w?key=UVNFRjljbnhMV01QNmFndERuSmd2UkdRUXhiR0VR) **$100** I would recommend a new battery for this (circa $20 on AliX). A really fun player, a very firm power/volume knob, a jog wheel for navigation, balanced output, *very* sturdy, op-amps can be easily swapped using a hatch in the back. Condition is showing wear, including scuffs to the screen. Hopefully it goes to a collector who plans to use it. AKM4490 chip.

### Cables

* [Youkamoo 4.4mm to XLR balanced cable](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP3ZRbogvbGO7kVog7faGH9T8uOqT6G7ZQmtxmY6F8KRJ2JeZSOsictIaf7qfUHFg?key=TXRTLTU5V0l5RVRJa3kwZlJ5U2paenJncVJ0dGN3) **12** *OR* $8 as an add-on. Nothing to really add here!

### Wireless buds and TWS

* [Noble Falcon Pro TWS](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOw-Gr-rWiQbx34rzPjL55cPIVtAGPKr9L1QP0iF9mm54shyNeRDL1Qd6bZGVYizQ?key=UlB4WW9yQzZEZWl6aHhBUGVRdDA5ck9ZNTBoSjNR) **$120** no damage anywhere, full accessories *except for tips, no tips*.

* [Mifo O7](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMu4fgDt2wDKab5RO7HqtIscMryVJGWcsJDOUZUWNDY8fSdyWVsBQ1PW35GdvtDIA?key=T3hsUEl2c2VYcEMzNHgwV1FEVUR4NklnejZTam9n) **$45** These are the version with the CNT dynamic driver. I highly recommend them for sound, comfort, and quality of build. The case alone is a step up from competitors. Comes with accessories incl. charge cable, box, tips.

* [Aukey EP-T32](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipND0RPSumTTxmlzMMs6c4SZvsUmszSB4ybTdnP0Q8H_OdaVskXe9lDBHU4lycdW-A?key=SDhfczNvUDJ2ZVhlQTFkTFpqTmFSUjJHU2VJRXZ3) **$15** Box, case, tips included, no cable. Powerbeats Pro form factor.

* [Apple/Beats Studio Buds](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMyWm572wyLthWgqvTBnrfXa1n4SJ5NmLiyTqka5h-eCNZUn1K5titA7RGoHyepdw?key=V3o1cTFMa0ozTTk1clgxd01ITDJVbUtCMGRuZlhB) **$40** Excellent condition, no tips but I can try to find something generic to include. As shown, warranty is active until 9/7/23.

* [Sony MDR-EX750BT](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMp85kZCF_AJTKP9JEaAB2yQKwpAPHX9rX67o9NvmYsiuPWx3toPp15yDzqE0xmpA?key=TlhfWWRXWFN1ZVVjY1NLanl4eHdna3UxaUVDZHVB) **$25** This form-factor has fallen out of vogue but it's actually still very practical/comfortable. Easy to take buds out and put them back in without keeping track of them. Appearance *and* sound remind me of MH750MH755, which is hinted at in the model name too.

It does not have stock keycaps (although stock spacebar is included. BUT it DOES come with the base set of CannonCaps Black on Grey!) This one is easily the closest to Topre out the Niz boards listed here. Unfortunately it uses costar stabilizers.

* [Niz Plum Atom 66 (35g)](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPoA5zHfFpbKhQIVYYuM4cQAU2Mqx-CKEXsCqotqoXENkhjCuYEVYOkMlJZOXhEwQ?key=MmNidlVvZ0RVdlVKWFhmMVRsNmNrbFFoejdzYWhR). **$75** Box, protector and accessories. White and grey stock caps. Not wireless.

* Same [rules/guidelines](#guidelines) as above.

* [Contour Unimouse](https://photos.app.goo.gl/h1qYKMJp6n4d2jHG8) **$25** Excellent ergonomics, which you can adjust on the fly. I find it can make some creaking in use, maybe lubing it somewhere would change that, to be honest I don't know if most people would notice or care. It looks like a purely cosmetic panel on the side is missing. Includes wireless connection dongle.

* Coming soon: GX 1650 Low-profile **$140**
