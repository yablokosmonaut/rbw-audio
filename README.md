## Headphones

* [VE Pro Super Nova](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tbgVABTy5Py1hca5A) **$50** You can see where the headstrap contacts the cups, no other visible wear to note. Pictured with Brainwavz perforated pads ($20 extra) either way comes with stock pads.
* [Sennheiser HD560S](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tbgVABTy5Py1hca5A) **$100** In excellent condition, original box, cable, velor pads, and 1/4 inch jack.
* [Fostex TR50P Modhouse Argon Mk3](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZSPBEwcvUwK98oDj9) **$240** Sad to let these go, but with what's needed to drive them and their slim use cases (have to be at a desk) they are not in budget. Has stock protein pads, ZMF protein pads, orange cable with 3.5mm termination, black cable with 1/4 inch termination, 3.5mm-1/4 inch adapter, and Alcantara suspension band. Box too. Condition may as well be open box.

## IEMs and earbuds

* [ISN EST50](https://photos.app.goo.gl/eucG7ZPQwoKagKNm7) **$320** Green on black stabilized wood faceplates, comes with stock cable and stock carry case, condition is excellent. Just a little too colored to be my EDC, and too expensive to keep alongside another set. I think they're a fantastically tuned bassy set, they remind me a lot of the Xenns Up. Smooth, spacious, and bass guitars never sounded so good.

* [Yanyin Canon]() **$220** Take off $6 to skip the outer box. All stock accessories. One set of flip switches is reversed but works as labeled, no issues with build or sound.

* [Penon Fan OG]() **$55** Stock accessories (cable, tips, case (to be frank, not the greatest stock cable). Beautiful stabilized wood.

* [RikuBuds Grand Archer]() **$50**
