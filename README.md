# rbw-audio
Rattlingblanketwoman's audio classifieds

### Headphones

* ~~[Sennheiser HD560S](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOe4RfGVWUpzqP9SXpbFZ02rAtEPf6VY9gZTpMA1XzDFDlijOCTwgTOy1YQaVjiog?key=azM3Ty1rQ1IxeUNoSEVYTmZ4UVlJdUxFeVdVZ2pR) **$95** In excellent condition, original box, cable, velor pads, and 1/4 inch jack.~~

* Coming soon: Corsair Void RGB Elite new in box

* ~~Coming soon: Audeze Mobius headphones with box and accessories~~

### IEMs and earbuds

* [Yanyin Canon](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNPQTt-p5jrirVbVY_M36ZKbP_m9v63Sr73zO6BPe_14N5OVeDH2voIH_FuKMb5lw?key=ZzA1VTNrN1JvRFVqVmdEUXRQejdWUUQwUnhZaWJn) **$220** Take off $6 to skip the outer box. All stock accessories. One set of flip switches is reversed but works as labeled, no issues with build or sound.

* ~~[Penon Fan OG](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM8L2Uc4HhkS9VkbUm1Zg5yiyinDxHjOVrOVJwtjUi48GKFSdXmfK-Vkif3m090EQ?key=UHl3MFBhRFpENTF6VmoycVNfM19sZ0tNRWtDcnh3) **$55** Stock accessories (cable, *many* tips, case (to be frank, not the greatest stock cable). Beautiful stabilized wood.~~

* ~~[Final E5000](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOJayqDZMaNDZ1NPD12qcr5iCYsce18zMg-dxGohucHiVW9BjL5Xr222OqugkUZgQ?key=TmhKbFRuQkoyN1ZjVGc2akxJTkVLazZyNUtGYWJB) **$120** Top notch condition, accessories and box too. Needs a lot of power to drive due to low sensitivity. Sadly when I got it to a volume level that I was really enjoying it, my wife could hear it too.~~

* [Tin HiFi P1](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMWNhGvLR8WRiAV5GFQ26Lk4Hmll0Ic92f2IF2NrWBhxU7nEcW56gd1Ah1BoAMRTA?key=bElfdV9zeUVJQkN0b3dmc0V2QUVZYjFsTWRnUXdn) **$80** Again, these need some power to sing, but have a great flat response that even so has good bass levels, but it does have sub-bass roll-off. Carrying box and accessories (one set of silicone tips missing, I *think* the L size).

* [KBEar F1](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPCh4hf4wXD7Hctsvp9Wra_0NufsW_-3KwpsN0MxncE2ZLKiZULjYql8OF93FNYvw?key=LXRWYTVlY1JkVW5FdHc4WTVaZXBuTVRzaUcxTjF3) **$10** each, or $6 each as add-ons. Single BA. Amber has 1 pair of tips missing, smokey has everything.

* Coming soon: NF Audio NE4 Revolution with box/accessories and all stock tuning plates *plus* a rare 4th tuning plate.

* Coming soon: NF Audio NM1 with box/accessories.

### Sources (DAC/DAP/AMP)

* [iFi Zen Blue DAC](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPQn4mpRBtzJDUeOPAXAbgC8WOiJJDwvCMWyEvvQPRHZ1D2n1-cGIlVJtHzeCM95w?key=Rk0td2ZFTE1Ed2pKOXozMXctci1zQ0N2MUUtczdn) **$100** I don't use any gear right now that would justify a dedicated DAC/AMP. Excellent condition, box, antenna, 5V power brick.

* [JDS Labs OL DAC](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMSvycc-DlPqKeYktfyMqxgEH9o8Ixe9rGIDeSbo9S6IDgObOUnGIqpi526paFEVw?key=TExzbU90S3gtUEpBbUg4bTI3Y1BLTlhnN1dnaGRB) **$50** No blemishes or issues to mention, comes with power brick.

* ~~[FiiO BTR7](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOoakkPCGDMHd2_3Rshz6wObLtEIdI-cKD-kFbodAn-m4IQWeCTj_ExMJBDQxptIA?key=V3NkRUY3bFM5a1ljVDBybVlCcS1naUUtYmUyNW5n) **$125** My favorite sounding FiiO BT dongle to date, and with very usable controls/interface. Like new condition + box and all accessories~~

* ~~[DDHifi TC35i](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOjTVpJxjOeG-rH8zOfiMyd1n0Vz3g_BUvP4dGSLu1VxwCqwHaHggVlcoZx5GRA6Q?key=MDNFc3Y4OE4tdTdiQkpFMHd6VzkwMTlTOUhfSkVB) **$15** It's an adapter, it works well.~~

* [LG V35 ThinQ](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNFLlsn4N2qsOiyIf1dghRobM-UD7qYA5cIlQNpvGWYYazYvTdSALDyiopWR6mjSw?key=MDR4SlUzVEZkbDU1RWNWamhxMFk5R0FNNHhKUVR3) **$60** It is an AT&T model, but can be flashed to an unbranded firmware or debloated using ADB commands. Battery life is great. Slight burn-in shown by nav bar, hence the photo of the "settings" screen to show shades of white. Overall very good condition indeed. There is nothing stopping this being used as phone/camera besides an excellent responsive DAP with a quad-DAC.

* [VentureCraft SounDroid Valoq](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNWe1tQaq63Mm-039L2Q9gK-eBD8R3VPxamwHH1A2drHMyRWklWcnoBFZX0gIY1-w?key=UVNFRjljbnhMV01QNmFndERuSmd2UkdRUXhiR0VR) **$120** I would recommend a new battery for this (circa $20 on AliX). A really fun player, a very firm power/volume knob, a jog wheel for navigation, balanced output, *very* sturdy, op-amps can be easily swapped using a hatch in the back. Condition is showing wear, including scuffs to the screen. Hopefully it goes to a collector who plans to use it. AKM4490 chip.

### Cables

* [Youkamoo 4.4mm to XLR balanced cable](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP3ZRbogvbGO7kVog7faGH9T8uOqT6G7ZQmtxmY6F8KRJ2JeZSOsictIaf7qfUHFg?key=TXRTLTU5V0l5RVRJa3kwZlJ5U2paenJncVJ0dGN3) **12** *OR* $8 as an add-on. Nothing to really add here!

### Wireless buds and TWS

* [Mifo O7](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMu4fgDt2wDKab5RO7HqtIscMryVJGWcsJDOUZUWNDY8fSdyWVsBQ1PW35GdvtDIA?key=T3hsUEl2c2VYcEMzNHgwV1FEVUR4NklnejZTam9n) **$50** These are the version with the CNT dynamic driver. I highly recommend them for sound, comfort, and quality of build. The case alone is a step up from competitors. Comes with accessories incl. charge cable, box, tips.

* [Aukey EP-T32](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipND0RPSumTTxmlzMMs6c4SZvsUmszSB4ybTdnP0Q8H_OdaVskXe9lDBHU4lycdW-A?key=SDhfczNvUDJ2ZVhlQTFkTFpqTmFSUjJHU2VJRXZ3) **$15** Box, case, tips included, no cable. Powerbeats Pro form factor.

* [Apple/Beats Studio Buds](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMyWm572wyLthWgqvTBnrfXa1n4SJ5NmLiyTqka5h-eCNZUn1K5titA7RGoHyepdw?key=V3o1cTFMa0ozTTk1clgxd01ITDJVbUtCMGRuZlhB) **$45** Excellent condition, no tips but I can try to find something generic to include. As shown, warranty is active until 9/7/23.

* [Sony MDR-EX750BT](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMp85kZCF_AJTKP9JEaAB2yQKwpAPHX9rX67o9NvmYsiuPWx3toPp15yDzqE0xmpA?key=TlhfWWRXWFN1ZVVjY1NLanl4eHdna3UxaUVDZHVB) **$25** This form-factor has fallen out of vogue but it's actually still very practical/comfortable. Easy to take buds out and put them back in without keeping track of them. Appearance *and* sound remind me of MH750MH755, which is hinted at in the model name too.

* Same [rules/guidelines](#guidelines) as above.

### Completes

* [Keychron K8 Pro TKL](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WCrqk3opXa7P7sti9) **$75** QMK/VIA compatible, stock red switches (factory lubed), wireless via dongle or Bluetooth, Win/Mac modes, very solidly built w/ aluminum frame. Condition is excellent.

* [Epomaker TH-66 Pro](https://photos.app.goo.gl/1ZNbKphY8qrFD32F8) **$70** Completely unused (open box) with **3** choices of knobs total. Comes with Monet MDA V2 keycap set, and the Flamingo linear switches. Stock cable and everything it would usually come with.

* [Royal Kludge RK84](https://photos.app.goo.gl/KPSuxwe94AMxLnNP6) **$50** Can connect via dongle or Bluetooth, RGB, I have packed the case with cotton for acoustic reasons but I can remove that no problem. Stock keycaps, stock red switches. Removable bezel.

* [Drop Alt (Low Profile)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/HsADNiEknp55jWUv9) **$75** Comes with stock shine-through caps, Seasalt Lemon linear switches, and magnetic feet.

It does not have stock keycaps (although stock spacebar is included. BUT it DOES come with the base set of CannonCaps Black on Grey!) This one is easily the closest to Topre out the Niz boards listed here. Unfortunately it uses costar stabilizers.

* [Niz Plum Atom 66 (35g)](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPoA5zHfFpbKhQIVYYuM4cQAU2Mqx-CKEXsCqotqoXENkhjCuYEVYOkMlJZOXhEwQ?key=MmNidlVvZ0RVdlVKWFhmMVRsNmNrbFFoejdzYWhR). **$75** Box, protector and accessories. White and grey stock caps. Not wireless.

### Keycaps

* [DEV/TTY MT3](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3b7hkpY2NbFyqm119) **$55** ABS, complete base set, I never used them because I thought all MT3 sets were PBT.

* [Susuwatari MT3](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNApYX-vBQIJY7olVC2vR-Gxg6NR2YTbFZe7jE0yLwH8th4keOfG1mvOsNn7vQVrg?key=YVI2cXVPaVhEY09pRlRSa2MwVk9zSTJWOW5zall3) **$50** Base set, used. I'm not experienced at gauging shine, took some angle shots to help you decide.

* Same [rules/guidelines](#guidelines) as above.

* [Contour Unimouse](https://photos.app.goo.gl/h1qYKMJp6n4d2jHG8) **$25** Excellent ergonomics, which you can adjust on the fly. I find it can make some creaking in use, maybe lubing it somewhere would change that, to be honest I don't know if most people would notice or care. It looks like a purely cosmetic panel on the side is missing. Includes wireless connection dongle.

* Coming soon: GX 1650 Low-profile **$140**
