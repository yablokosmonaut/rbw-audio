I understand F&F can be an trust issue and fully respect anyone's decision to avoid trading when they see it. For any open to persuasion on a case by case basis, I can at least offer the following assurances:

* 63 confirmed trades on /avexchange as of 3/23/23. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=AVexchangeBot&subject=Feedback%20Check&message=Enter%20username%20below%20that%20you%20want%20to%20check:%0A%0Au/rattlingblanketwoman">(Check with AVExchangeBot now)</a>

I made the US account US discount codes would work.)

### IEMs and earbuds

*  [Hifiman RE-262](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnjjOPesFW-yyk_WDOjfZhaljwXZ80u6A1o-lZBVzP08JNuyjVIM6unjYTIDoPvg?key=SDBTNzhWb0FqTHNpVWh0RmxCMTU3R3loVjZuRW5B) **$50** A pretty ancient set by now, but very natural/neutral/I like the mids. Comes in a pretty dope case with cable extension choices and tips. Can be worn down or up. Unusual appearance!

* ~~[Moondrop Lan](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMBfk-kf3VmbHJc68Mkgw-lHQr8gje4HcK15mOyVFLOstKu0SKO4n27mswShBZRHg?key=eEItcV9UaUpFMEtaZVg4N1N6eGV2UnFtQUxLM1JB)**$25** or add on for $20~~

* [Tangzu Wan'Er](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMKjbqA1zx2wTTvI9XCQetJ7D89PItBipldfy77eRSF5z7K57i73paA0VvvvkLXZQ?key=M2cxUExrVjJJaGdqeWFSNFVvbUJoRUpPU1lRa2pB)**$15** or bundle for 10 For some reason I pictured it with the wrong cable, but it will come with its stock cable.

* [Sealed - RevoNext NEX202 open-back earphones](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPZndIRDQv1poCK8IQM4IHmzRRPNUTAsLItVUUyd4NXfy4y-DDEp8TLuMumF0sNhA?key=NlNqM2VzdVJ1Q1pDNWtyUkZYekFCLTBLRlRNWkxR) **$20** or bundle for $15

* [Tin Hifi C2 "Mech Warrior"](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMFXGpUAjYZeyKTwwbcYMy3DYS8Vzl9IvVuvjK2StLP2H3ZtFQB8tx80iaTZj72cA?key=bkdjVDBPR3lneE9IelRtbzdPLUxjbWtKSVE5YkJR) **$15** or add on for $10. Boxed and accessories.

* [Sealed - Edifier H180 earbuds](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO7fFSrmPm0hH-khrHe116YTtJaYochppBdRq-LzJ8YwbnO2Qt5MtxTS49zM3AKRg?key=T1E0aWoxc2ltMmYxTTlpX2RPX0toUHBRaEY0SmVR) Yours for the cost of shipping, or free added on.

### Sources (DAC/DAP/AMP)

* [JDS Labs OL DAC](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMSvycc-DlPqKeYktfyMqxgEH9o8Ixe9rGIDeSbo9S6IDgObOUnGIqpi526paFEVw?key=TExzbU90S3gtUEpBbUg4bTI3Y1BLTlhnN1dnaGRB) **$45** No blemishes or issues to mention, comes with power brick.

* [F.Audio XS-02](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO_tVCHRosIN5wPTTuJDBO_GBE0M58XDSXBN6SVw1tN-nWs1j0O-uwkJ9hRrAG1-Q?key=VGNwUnN3S3puSThjYkNqYXRSTFBqTjJ0T0dsZTVR) **$75** I love this player. It has an AKM4490 chip and great dynamics. I love the clicky buttons. You can swap the op-amps out very easily. It has a low and high gain port (both 3.5mm) and takes MicroSD cards and uses MicroUSB for charging. Holds a very good charge.

* [VentureCraft SounDroid Valoq](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNWe1tQaq63Mm-039L2Q9gK-eBD8R3VPxamwHH1A2drHMyRWklWcnoBFZX0gIY1-w?key=UVNFRjljbnhMV01QNmFndERuSmd2UkdRUXhiR0VR) **$100** I would recommend a new battery for this (circa $20 on AliX). A really fun player, a very firm power/volume knob, a jog wheel for navigation, balanced output, *very* sturdy, op-amps can be easily swapped using a hatch in the back. Condition is showing wear, including scuffs to the screen. Hopefully it goes to a collector who plans to use it. AKM4490 chip.

### Switches

N/A

### Keycaps

* [DEV/TTY MT3](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3b7hkpY2NbFyqm119) **$55** ABS, complete base set, I never used them because I thought all MT3 sets were PBT.

* [Susuwatari MT3](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNApYX-vBQIJY7olVC2vR-Gxg6NR2YTbFZe7jE0yLwH8th4keOfG1mvOsNn7vQVrg?key=YVI2cXVPaVhEY09pRlRSa2MwVk9zSTJWOW5zall3) **$50** Base set, used. I'm not experienced at gauging shine, took some angle shots to help you decide.

* Same [rules/guidelines](#guidelines) as above.

* [Contour Unimouse](https://photos.app.goo.gl/h1qYKMJp6n4d2jHG8) **$25** Excellent ergonomics, which you can adjust on the fly. I find it can make some creaking in use, maybe lubing it somewhere would change that, to be honest I don't know if most people would notice or care. It looks like a purely cosmetic panel on the side is missing. Includes wireless connection dongle.
